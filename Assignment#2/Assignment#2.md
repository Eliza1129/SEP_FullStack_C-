# 03 Object-Oriented Programming
### Test your knowledge
1. What are the six combinations of access modifier keywords and what do they do? 
- Use `public` if you want global accessibility.
- Use `private` to encapsulate class members.
- Use `protected` when you want inheritance access only.
- Use `Internal` to restrict uasge within the same project.
- Use `protected internal` when you need both inheritance and same=assembly access.
- Use `private protected` for strict inheritance control within the same project.
2. What is the difference between the static, const, and readonly keywords when applied to
a type member?
- 
3. What does a constructor do?
- A constructor is a special method in a class that initializes an object when it is created.
4. Why is the partial keyword useful?
- The partial keyword allows a class or method to be split into multiple files, especially using for large classes spread across multiple files for better organization.
5. What is a tuple?
- A tuple is a lightweight data structure that groups multiple values together.
6. What does the C# record keyword do?
- C# record is a reference type that is immutable by default and used for data models.
7. What does overloading and overriding mean?
- Overloading is multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
- Overriding is a subclass replaces a base class method. 
8. What is the difference between a field and a property?
- Field is a variable that holds data directly. Property is encapsulated access to a field with get and set. Properties provide controlled access, while fields are direct data storage.
9. How do you make a method parameter optional?
- Use default values or params.
10. What is an interface and how is it different from abstract class?
- An interface defines a contract like methods or properties without implementation. Using interfaces when you need multiple inheritance.
- Use abstract classes when you need shared implementation.
11. What accessibility level are members of an interface?
- All members in an interface are public by default and can not use private, protected or internal.
